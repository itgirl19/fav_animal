  <p>
    The gray wolf is a habitat generalist, and can live in deserts, grasslands, forests and arctic tundras. <br>

	Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, <br>
	foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores.<br>
	They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs.
